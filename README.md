# Dynamic Programming vs. Branch and Bound for Solving Set Partition Problem

## Introduction
This repository aims to compare the performance of two popular sorting algorithms: Dynamic Programming and Branch and Bound. The comparison focuses on execution time and memory usage to provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Usage
To compare the two sorting algorithms, you can use the provided Python scripts:

- set_partition_dp.py: Contains the Dynamic programming implementation.
- set_partition_bnb.py: Contains the Branch and Bound implementation.
- random_dataset.py: This script generates the dataset needed for comparing the two algorithms.
- profiler.py: This script performs the algorithm comparison and measures execution time and memory usage.

## Results
The results of the comparison will be displayed in the console and saved in a report file. You can analyze the execution time and memory usage of Dynamic Programming and Branch and Bound for different input sizes.
